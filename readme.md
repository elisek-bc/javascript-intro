# Javascript Intro

## What?
This exercise series in made up of different parts. 

0. Hello World!
1. Variables
2. Operators
3. Control Structures
4. Functions
5. Arrays
6. Objects
7. RFW

The first exercises from 0 to 6 focus on learning and understanding, while 7 is more intractive. I already tackled 7 in a previous series of exercises. You can find those results [here](https://github.com/elisek-bc/javascript-bonus/tree/master/08-ES6-read-fix-write).

## Timing
The series of exercises was given to me on Monday 3th of June. I will work on it from today on, till Friday 7th of June.

## Answers on questions in exercises

### What is a variable?
<em>A variable contains information. It stores what you put in it somewhere, so you can access it later on in an easier and more readable way. You can see it like a box with a label, that makes it easier to find the information you need.</em>

### How do you declare a variable?
<em> For example: var exampleNumber = 5. See next question for more info</em>

### What are the tree different keywords to define one?
<em>
- let
- const
- var
</em>

### What's the difference between them?

<em>A variable declared with <strong>var</strong> is accessible everywhere in your application and can be adjusted after its creation.</em>

<em> A variable declared with <strong>let</strong> is only available between the curly brackets. It's called <strong>block scoped</strong> You can redefine it though, something that is not possible with the next one.

<em> A variable declared with <strong>const</strong> is also block scoped and only usable between curly brackets. It can't be changed after you declared it. It's a constant value within your code.

### How do you properly name a variable?

The name can consist of letters, numbers, $ and the name does not begin with a number.

A longer name is best written in <strong>camelCase</strong>.

## Personal reminders
You can find my notes of this exercises as well on Studyblue, since it was more of an understanding exercise. I made reminders to myself for later on, to use during the rest of the exercises.

## Difficulties
The 6th part, about Objects, is still kinda vague to me. I get the thing with key value pairs and properties. But storing methods in object is something that I don't understand the use of and wouldn't know how to implement it.
