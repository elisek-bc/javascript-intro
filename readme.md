## Answers on questions in exercises

### What is a variable?
<em>A variable contains information. It stores what you put in it somewhere, so you can access it later on in an easier and more readable way. You can see it like a box with a label, that makes it easier to find the information you need.</em>

### How do you declare a variable?
<em> For example: var exampleNumber = 5. See next question for more info</em>

### What are the tree different keywords to define one?
<em>
- let
- const
- var
</em>

### What's the difference between them?

<em>A variable declared with <strong>var</strong> is accessible everywhere in your application and can be adjusted after its creation.</em>

<em> A variable declared with <strong>let</strong> is only available between the curly brackets. It's called <strong>block scoped</strong> You can redefine it though, something that is not possible with the next one.

<em> A variable declared with <strong>const</strong> is also block scoped and only usable between curly brackets. It can't be changed after you declared it. It's a constant value within your code.

### How do you properly name a variable?

The name can consist of letters, numbers, $ and the name does not begin with a number.

A longer name is best written in <strong>camelCase</strong>.
