* Look at the documentation of the join() function. Explain how it is used here.

<em>
join() merges different array elements into 1 element. When there's nothing between brackets, it puts comma's inbetween the elements, when there's a space it puts things just connected to eachother, when there's a '-' it puts - inbetween.
