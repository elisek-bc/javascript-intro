* The for-loop is no longer present. 
  What was it replaced with? How does this work?

  <em> The for loop is replaced with a forEach loop. It will do the following function for every element in the preceding array. </em>

* What does the function 'parseTitle' do? 
  What parameter do we pass to this function?

  <em> parseTitle turns the parameter to lowercase and puts that in a variable. Then it wraps the variable in list tags, and writes the result on the page.</em>

* What does the function 'wrapWithTag' do? 
  Why are the parameters placed between brackets?

  <em> The function wrap with tag wraps text in between tags. The first parameter is the content, the second is which tag needs to be placed around it.</em>
