## EX 13
* Examine the parseMovieData function. What has changed? Why aren't we using forEach here? 

<em>

</em>

* Look at the documentation of for...in
* Look at the documentation of the .sort(Ã  function. Explain how it's applied here.

<em>
sort() sorts an array by a certain function. In this case it sorts it by descending published year.
</em>

* Notice the 2 console.table() functions. Go back to exercise 10 and console.log the movies array  before and after the createList function. What's the difference? Can you explain why there is a difference?

<em>
console.table does the same as console.log but places the array elements in a table with their properties.
